# MIT-Bus-Stops

In this project I created a map using the mapbox api and plugging in the data for the various latitude and longitudes for the bus stops on the way from MIT to Harvard with a button that will show the bus stop along the route every 3 seconds. 

As I learn more, I plan to add in additional APIs to allow the user to see a larger map and the addittional bus stops, as well as more icons. This way it becomes a better map for the user and something that can be more useful for the user.
